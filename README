MT-Builder-XS version 0.01
==========================

This is a drop-in replacement to the Pure-Perl compiler inside MT::Builder.
After installation, MT::Builder will detect that it is installed, and 
will use it instead of the Perl compiler. 

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Please make sure that you are installing on the same Perl that MT is using
